Anomaly Detection in Autonomous Vehicles, UCI | Researcher, supervised by Prof. Fadi Kurdahi  06-09/2020

Employed the Carla simulator to perform real-time vehicle driving simulation

Aggregated data from different types of sensors by attaching these sensors in the ego car and implemented the callback function

Filtered data to extract features that are mostly relative to collision anomaly detection and then trained models

Applied outlier detection algorithms (e.g. KNN, Variational AutoEncoder) in Python Outlier Detection (PyOD) to detect abnormal situations

Achievement: designed a new strategy for anomaly detection and identified VAE (variable auto-encoder) as the best algorithm for this detection;
