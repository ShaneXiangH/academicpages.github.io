Collaborative Motion and Multi-target Searching Methods of Swarm Intelligent Robots |Team Leader         09/2019 - 05/2021
Awarded 2020 "Climbing Plan" Special Fund for Science and Technology Innovation Cultivation of College Students in Guangdong Province (Funding code: PDJH2020b0522, Percentage: 10/400+, Fund received＞RMB 40,000, 12/2019)

Employed the strategy of collaborative motion and multi-target searching of swarm intelligent robots under the condition of decentralized topology architecture and limited sense of perception and info-communication ability

Established the corresponding simulation and experiment system using mobile robot simulation platforms like MATLAB and Webots as well as real robots like E-Puck and TurtleBot to verify the effectiveness of relevant methods

Proposed a new potential field (PF) based multi-robot movement strategy for it, where Brain Strom Optimizing (BSO) algorithm plays an important role in contributing to local area potential field, and applied the strategy to detect the pollution source

Under the same map condition, my strategy performs a generally higher performance on multi-target searching in MATLAB multi-robot environment, compared to other classic multi-robot movement strategies

Proposed an exploration enhanced Robotic Particle Swarm Optimization (E2RPSO) method for multi-target searching problems on robotic swarms

The proposed method modifies the third item in the RPSO as an additional attraction term, not only enables the robot to avoid collisions but also guides the swarm to search unexplored regions as much as possible. This operation increases the swarm’s task-specific (top-down) diversity, making the system cover a broader search area and avoid falling into local optimums.
